The context for\n * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n * to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls\n * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n * as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted).

It encodes inheritance, properties, and events.\n *\n * ## Overview\n *\n * Each line represents one kind of element. The `element_inheritance` and properties are joined\n * using `element_inheritance|properties` syntax.\n *\n * ## Element Inheritance\n *\n * The `element_inheritance` can be further subdivided as `element1,element2,...^parentElement`.\n * Here the individual elements are separated by `,` (commas). Every element in the list\n * has identical properties.\n *\n * An `element` may inherit additional properties from `parentElement` If no `^parentElement` is\n * specified then `\"\"` (blank) element is assumed.\n *\n * NOTE: The blank element inherits from root `*` element, the super element of all elements.\n *\n * NOTE an element prefix such as `:svg:` has no special meaning to the schema.\n *\n * ## Properties\n *\n * Each element has a set of properties separated by `,` (commas). Each property can be prefixed\n * by a special character designating its type:\n *\n * - (no prefix): property is a string.\n * - `*`: property represents an event.\n * - `!`: property is a boolean.\n * - `#`: property is a number.\n * - `%`: property is an object.\n *\n * ## Query\n *\n * The class creates an internal squas representation which allows to easily answer the query of\n * if a given property exist on a given element.\n *\n * NOTE: We don't yet support querying for types or events.\n * NOTE: This schema is auto extracted from `schema_extractor.ts` located in the test folder,\n *       see dom_element_schema_registry_spec.ts\n */\n// =================================================================================================\n// =================================================================================================\n// =========== S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P  ===========\n// =================================================================================================\n// =================================================================================================\n//\n//                       DO NOT EDIT THIS DOM SCHEMA WITHOUT A SECURITY REVIEW!\n//\n// Newly added properties must be security reviewed and assigned an appropriate SecurityContext in\n// dom_security_schema.ts.

Calls to `animate` are expected to be\n * used within {@link sequence an animation sequence}, {@link group group}, or {@link transition\n * transition}.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n *\n * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional\n * delay and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n * delay=100, easing=ease-out`.\n * If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the `duration` value in millisecond\n * form.\n * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {@link style style} or {@link\n * keyframes keyframes}.\n * If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected and used (this is\n * useful when\n * describing an animation step that will complete an animation by {@link\n * transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // various functions for specifying timing data\n * animate(500, style(...))\n * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n *\n * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * animate(500, keyframes([\n *   style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n *   style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n *\n * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * @experimental Animation support is experimental.\n */\nexport function animate(timing, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    var stylesEntry = styles;\n    if (!isPresent(stylesEntry)) {\n        var EMPTY_STYLE = {};\n        stylesEntry = new AnimationStyleMetadata([EMPTY_STYLE], 1);\n    }\n    return new AnimationAnimateMetadata(timing, stylesEntry);\n}\n/**\n * `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n * animation\n * DSL language.

It is copied from DirectiveMetadata.\n/**\n * Directives allow you to attach behavior to elements in the DOM.\n *\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata}s with an embedded view are called {@link ComponentMetadata}s.\n *\n * A directive consists of a single directive annotation and a controller class. When the\n * directive's `selector` matches\n * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\n *\n * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\n * arguments.\n * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\n * depth-first order,\n *    as declared in the HTML.\n *\n * ## Understanding How Injection Works\n *\n * There are three stages of injection resolution.\n * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\n *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\n * the dependency was\n *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\n *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\n * location, and others.\n * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\n * the same parent-child hierarchy\n *     as the component instances in the DOM.\n * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\n * element has an `ElementInjector`\n *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\n *\n * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\n * depth-first order. The\n * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\n *\n * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\n * {@link ComponentMetadata}:\n *\n * 1. Dependencies on the current element\n * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\n * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\n * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\n *\n *\n * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\n * delegate to the parent\n * injector.\n *\n * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\n * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\n * element and the\n *    Shadow DOM root.\n * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\n * directives.\n * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\n * child directives.\n *\n * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\n * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\n * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\n * practice.\n *\n *\n * Assume this HTML template:\n *\n * ```\n * <div dependency=\"1\">\n *   <div dependency=\"2\">\n *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\n *       <div dependency=\"4\">\n *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\n *       </div>\n *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\n *\n * ```\n * @Injectable()\n * class SomeService {\n * }\n *\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[dependency]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'id: dependency'\n *   ]\n * })\n * class Dependency {\n *   id:string;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\n *\n *\n * ### No injection\n *\n * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\n * `MyDirective`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor() {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\n *\n *\n * ### Component-level injection\n *\n * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\n * parents.\n *\n * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\n * from the parent\n * component's injector.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\n * `dependency=\"3\"`.\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\n * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\n * parent element, or its parents.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\n * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\n * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\n * have returned\n * `dependency=\"1\"`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\n *\n *\n * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\n * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\n * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\n * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\n * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\n * 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\n *\n * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\n * elements.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\n *\n * ### Optional injection\n *\n * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\n * resolved. If you\n * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\n * with `@Optional()`.\n * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\n * optional.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\n * If none can be\n * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[tooltip]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'text: tooltip'\n *   ],\n *   host: {\n *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\n *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\n *   }\n * })\n * class Tooltip{\n *   text:string;\n *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *\n *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\n *     this.overlayManager = overlayManager;\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseEnter() {\n *     // exact signature to be determined\n *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseLeave() {\n *     this.overlay.close();\n *     this.overlay = null;\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\n * `tooltip` selector,\n * like so:\n *\n * ```\n * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\n * elements:\n *\n * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\n * runtime.\n * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\n * location in the current view\n * where these actions are performed.\n *\n * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ComponentMetadata}, and as siblings of\n * the\n * `<template>` element. Thus a\n * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\n *\n * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\n * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\n * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\n * equivalent.\n *\n * Thus,\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Expands in use to:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\n *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\n *   </template>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\n * the directive\n * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\n *\n * ## Lifecycle hooks\n *\n * When the directive class implements some {@linkDocs guide/lifecycle-hooks} the\n * callbacks are called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the\n * directive.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\n *\n * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[unless]',\n *   inputs: ['unless']\n * })\n * export class Unless {\n *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\n *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\n *   prevCondition: boolean;\n *\n *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\n *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\n *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\n *     this.prevCondition = null;\n *   }\n *\n *   set unless(newCondition) {\n *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = true;\n *       this.viewContainer.clear();\n *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = false;\n *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\n * and the result is:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\n *     <li></li>\n *   </template>\n *   <li></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\n * the instantiated\n * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\n * @stable\n * @Annotation\n */\nexport var Directive = makeDecorator(DirectiveMetadata);\n/**\n * Specifies that a constant attribute value should be injected.\n *\n * The directive can inject constant string literals of host element attributes.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Suppose we have an `<input>` element and want to know its `type`.\n *\n * ```html\n * <input type=\"text\">\n * ```\n *\n * A decorator can inject string literal `text` like so:\n *\n * {@example core/ts/metadata/metadata.ts region='attributeMetadata'}\n * @stable\n * @Annotation\n */\nexport var Attribute = makeParamDecorator(AttributeMetadata);\n// TODO(alexeagle): remove the duplication of this doc.

When the\n * directive's `selector` matches\n * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\n *\n * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\n * arguments.\n * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\n * depth-first order,\n *    as declared in the HTML.\n *\n * ## Understanding How Injection Works\n *\n * There are three stages of injection resolution.\n * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\n *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\n * the dependency was\n *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\n *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\n * location, and others.\n * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\n * the same parent-child hierarchy\n *     as the component instances in the DOM.\n * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\n * element has an `ElementInjector`\n *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\n *\n * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\n * depth-first order. The\n * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\n *\n * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\n * {@link ComponentMetadata}:\n *\n * 1. Dependencies on the current element\n * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\n * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\n * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\n *\n *\n * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\n * delegate to the parent\n * injector.\n *\n * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\n * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\n * element and the\n *    Shadow DOM root.\n * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\n * directives.\n * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\n * child directives.\n *\n * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\n * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\n * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\n * practice.\n *\n *\n * Assume this HTML template:\n *\n * ```\n * <div dependency=\"1\">\n *   <div dependency=\"2\">\n *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\n *       <div dependency=\"4\">\n *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\n *       </div>\n *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\n *\n * ```\n * @Injectable()\n * class SomeService {\n * }\n *\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[dependency]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'id: dependency'\n *   ]\n * })\n * class Dependency {\n *   id:string;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\n *\n *\n * ### No injection\n *\n * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\n * `MyDirective`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor() {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\n *\n *\n * ### Component-level injection\n *\n * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\n * parents.\n *\n * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\n * from the parent\n * component's injector.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\n * `dependency=\"3\"`.\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\n * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\n * parent element, or its parents.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\n * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\n * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\n * have returned\n * `dependency=\"1\"`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\n *\n *\n * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\n * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\n * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\n * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\n * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\n * `Dependency` 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\n *\n * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\n * elements.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\n *\n * ### Optional injection\n *\n * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\n * resolved. If you\n * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\n * with `@Optional()`.\n * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\n * optional.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\n * If none can be\n * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[tooltip]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'text: tooltip'\n *   ],\n *   host: {\n *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\n *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\n *   }\n * })\n * class Tooltip{\n *   text:string;\n *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *\n *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\n *     this.overlay = overlay;\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseEnter() {\n *     // exact signature to be determined\n *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseLeave() {\n *     this.overlay.close();\n *     this.overlay = null;\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\n * `tooltip` selector,\n * like so:\n *\n * ```\n * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\n * elements:\n *\n * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\n * runtime.\n * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\n * location in the current view\n * where these actions are performed.\n *\n * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ComponentMetadata}, and as siblings of\n * the\n * `<template>` element. Thus a\n * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\n *\n * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\n * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\n * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\n * equivalent.\n *\n * Thus,\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Expands in use to:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\n *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\n *   </template>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\n * the directive\n * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\n *\n * ## Lifecycle hooks\n *\n * When the directive class implements some {@linkDocs guide/lifecycle-hooks} the\n * callbacks are called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the\n * directive.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\n *\n * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[unless]',\n *   inputs: ['unless']\n * })\n * export class Unless {\n *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\n *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\n *   prevCondition: boolean;\n *\n *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\n *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\n *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\n *     this.prevCondition = null;\n *   }\n *\n *   set unless(newCondition) {\n *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = true;\n *       this.viewContainer.clear();\n *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = false;\n *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\n * and the result is:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\n *     <li></li>\n *   </template>\n *   <li></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\n * the instantiated\n * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\n * @stable\n */\nexport var DirectiveMetadata = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(DirectiveMetadata, _super);\n    function DirectiveMetadata(_a) {\n        var _b = _a === void 0 ? {} : _a, selector = _b.selector, inputs = _b.inputs, outputs = _b.outputs, host = _b.host, providers = _b.providers, exportAs = _b.exportAs, queries = _b.queries;\n        _super.call(this);\n        this.selector = selector;\n        this._inputs = inputs;\n        this._outputs = outputs;\n        this.host = host;\n        this.exportAs = exportAs;\n        this.queries = queries;\n        this._providers = providers;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(DirectiveMetadata.prototype, \"inputs\", {\n        /**\n         * Enumerates the set of data-bound input properties for a directive\n         *\n         * Angular automatically updates input properties during change detection.\n         *\n         * The `inputs` property defines a set of `directiveProperty` to `bindingProperty`\n         * configuration:\n         *\n         * -

The context for\n * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n * to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls\n * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n * as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n *\n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n *\n * With `<template>` element:\n *\n * ```\n * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </template>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n *\n * @stable\n */\nexport var NgFor = (function () {\n    function NgFor(_viewContainer, _templateRef, _iterableDiffers, _cdr) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._templateRef = _templateRef;\n        this._iterableDiffers = _iterableDiffers;\n        this._cdr = _cdr;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        set: function (value) {\n            if (isPresent(value)) {\n                this._templateRef = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (isBlank(this._differ) && isPresent(value)) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._iterableDiffers.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.

Calls to `animate` are expected to be\n * used within {@link sequence an animation sequence}, {@link group group}, or {@link transition\n * transition}.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n *\n * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional\n * delay and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n * delay=100, easing=ease-out`.\n * If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the `duration` value in millisecond\n * form.\n * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {@link style style} or {@link\n * keyframes keyframes}.\n * If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected and used (this is\n * useful when\n * describing an animation step that will complete an animation by {@link\n * transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // various functions for specifying timing data\n * animate(500, style(...))\n * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n *\n * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * animate(500, keyframes([\n *   style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n *   style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n *\n * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * @experimental Animation support is experimental.\n */\nexport function animate(timing, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    var stylesEntry = styles;\n    if (!isPresent(stylesEntry)) {\n        var EMPTY_STYLE = {};\n        stylesEntry = new AnimationStyleMetadata([EMPTY_STYLE], 1);\n    }\n    return new AnimationAnimateMetadata(timing, stylesEntry);\n}\n/**\n * `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n * animation\n * DSL language.

It is copied from DirectiveMetadata.\n/**\n * Directives allow you to attach behavior to elements in the DOM.\n *\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata}s with an embedded view are called {@link ComponentMetadata}s.\n *\n * A directive consists of a single directive annotation and a controller class. When the\n * directive's `selector` matches\n * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\n *\n * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\n * arguments.\n * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\n * depth-first order,\n *    as declared in the HTML.\n *\n * ## Understanding How Injection Works\n *\n * There are three stages of injection resolution.\n * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\n *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\n * the dependency was\n *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\n *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\n * location, and others.\n * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\n * the same parent-child hierarchy\n *     as the component instances in the DOM.\n * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\n * element has an `ElementInjector`\n *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\n *\n * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\n * depth-first order. The\n * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\n *\n * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\n * {@link ComponentMetadata}:\n *\n * 1. Dependencies on the current element\n * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\n * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\n * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\n *\n *\n * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\n * delegate to the parent\n * injector.\n *\n * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\n * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\n * element and the\n *    Shadow DOM root.\n * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\n * directives.\n * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\n * child directives.\n *\n * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\n * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\n * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\n * practice.\n *\n *\n * Assume this HTML template:\n *\n * ```\n * <div dependency=\"1\">\n *   <div dependency=\"2\">\n *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\n *       <div dependency=\"4\">\n *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\n *       </div>\n *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\n *\n * ```\n * @Injectable()\n * class SomeService {\n * }\n *\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[dependency]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'id: dependency'\n *   ]\n * })\n * class Dependency {\n *   id:string;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\n *\n *\n * ### No injection\n *\n * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\n * `MyDirective`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor() {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\n *\n *\n * ### Component-level injection\n *\n * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\n * parents.\n *\n * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\n * from the parent\n * component's injector.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\n * `dependency=\"3\"`.\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\n * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\n * parent element, or its parents.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\n * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\n * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\n * have returned\n * `dependency=\"1\"`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\n *\n *\n * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\n * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\n * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\n * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\n * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\n * 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\n *\n * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\n * elements.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\n *\n * ### Optional injection\n *\n * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\n * resolved. If you\n * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\n * with `@Optional()`.\n * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\n * optional.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\n * If none can be\n * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[tooltip]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'text: tooltip'\n *   ],\n *   host: {\n *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\n *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\n *   }\n * })\n * class Tooltip{\n *   text:string;\n *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *\n *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\n *     this.overlayManager = overlayManager;\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseEnter() {\n *     // exact signature to be determined\n *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseLeave() {\n *     this.overlay.close();\n *     this.overlay = null;\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\n * `tooltip` selector,\n * like so:\n *\n * ```\n * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\n * elements:\n *\n * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\n * runtime.\n * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\n * location in the current view\n * where these actions are performed.\n *\n * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ComponentMetadata}, and as siblings of\n * the\n * `<template>` element. Thus a\n * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\n *\n * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\n * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\n * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\n * equivalent.\n *\n * Thus,\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Expands in use to:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\n *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\n *   </template>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\n * the directive\n * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\n *\n * ## Lifecycle hooks\n *\n * When the directive class implements some {@linkDocs guide/lifecycle-hooks} the\n * callbacks are called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the\n * directive.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\n *\n * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[unless]',\n *   inputs: ['unless']\n * })\n * export class Unless {\n *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\n *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\n *   prevCondition: boolean;\n *\n *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\n *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\n *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\n *     this.prevCondition = null;\n *   }\n *\n *   set unless(newCondition) {\n *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = true;\n *       this.viewContainer.clear();\n *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = false;\n *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\n * and the result is:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\n *     <li></li>\n *   </template>\n *   <li></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\n * the instantiated\n * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\n * @stable\n * @Annotation\n */\nexport var Directive = makeDecorator(DirectiveMetadata);\n/**\n * Specifies that a constant attribute value should be injected.\n *\n * The directive can inject constant string literals of host element attributes.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Suppose we have an `<input>` element and want to know its `type`.\n *\n * ```html\n * <input type=\"text\">\n * ```\n *\n * A decorator can inject string literal `text` like so:\n *\n * {@example core/ts/metadata/metadata.ts region='attributeMetadata'}\n * @stable\n * @Annotation\n */\nexport var Attribute = makeParamDecorator(AttributeMetadata);\n// TODO(alexeagle): remove the duplication of this doc.

When the\n * directive's `selector` matches\n * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\n *\n * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\n * arguments.\n * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\n * depth-first order,\n *    as declared in the HTML.\n *\n * ## Understanding How Injection Works\n *\n * There are three stages of injection resolution.\n * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\n *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\n * the dependency was\n *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\n *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\n * location, and others.\n * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\n * the same parent-child hierarchy\n *     as the component instances in the DOM.\n * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\n * element has an `ElementInjector`\n *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\n *\n * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\n * depth-first order. The\n * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\n *\n * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\n * {@link ComponentMetadata}:\n *\n * 1. Dependencies on the current element\n * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\n * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\n * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\n *\n *\n * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\n * delegate to the parent\n * injector.\n *\n * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\n * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\n * element and the\n *    Shadow DOM root.\n * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\n * directives.\n * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\n * child directives.\n *\n * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\n * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\n * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\n * practice.\n *\n *\n * Assume this HTML template:\n *\n * ```\n * <div dependency=\"1\">\n *   <div dependency=\"2\">\n *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\n *       <div dependency=\"4\">\n *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\n *       </div>\n *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\n *\n * ```\n * @Injectable()\n * class SomeService {\n * }\n *\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[dependency]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'id: dependency'\n *   ]\n * })\n * class Dependency {\n *   id:string;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\n *\n *\n * ### No injection\n *\n * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\n * `MyDirective`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor() {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\n *\n *\n * ### Component-level injection\n *\n * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\n * parents.\n *\n * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\n * from the parent\n * component's injector.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\n * `dependency=\"3\"`.\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\n * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\n * parent element, or its parents.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\n * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\n * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\n * have returned\n * `dependency=\"1\"`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\n *\n *\n * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\n * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\n * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\n * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\n * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\n * `Dependency` 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\n *\n * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\n * elements.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\n *\n * ### Optional injection\n *\n * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\n * resolved. If you\n * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\n * with `@Optional()`.\n * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\n * optional.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\n * If none can be\n * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[tooltip]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'text: tooltip'\n *   ],\n *   host: {\n *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\n *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\n *   }\n * })\n * class Tooltip{\n *   text:string;\n *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *\n *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\n *     this.overlay = overlay;\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseEnter() {\n *     // exact signature to be determined\n *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseLeave() {\n *     this.overlay.close();\n *     this.overlay = null;\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\n * `tooltip` selector,\n * like so:\n *\n * ```\n * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\n * elements:\n *\n * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\n * runtime.\n * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\n * location in the current view\n * where these actions are performed.\n *\n * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ComponentMetadata}, and as siblings of\n * the\n * `<template>` element. Thus a\n * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\n *\n * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\n * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\n * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\n * equivalent.\n *\n * Thus,\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Expands in use to:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\n *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\n *   </template>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\n * the directive\n * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\n *\n * ## Lifecycle hooks\n *\n * When the directive class implements some {@linkDocs guide/lifecycle-hooks} the\n * callbacks are called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the\n * directive.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\n *\n * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[unless]',\n *   inputs: ['unless']\n * })\n * export class Unless {\n *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\n *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\n *   prevCondition: boolean;\n *\n *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\n *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\n *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\n *     this.prevCondition = null;\n *   }\n *\n *   set unless(newCondition) {\n *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = true;\n *       this.viewContainer.clear();\n *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = false;\n *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\n * and the result is:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\n *     <li></li>\n *   </template>\n *   <li></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\n * the instantiated\n * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\n * @stable\n */\nexport var DirectiveMetadata = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(DirectiveMetadata, _super);\n    function DirectiveMetadata(_a) {\n        var _b = _a === void 0 ? {} : _a, selector = _b.selector, inputs = _b.inputs, outputs = _b.outputs, host = _b.host, providers = _b.providers, exportAs = _b.exportAs, queries = _b.queries;\n        _super.call(this);\n        this.selector = selector;\n        this._inputs = inputs;\n        this._outputs = outputs;\n        this.host = host;\n        this.exportAs = exportAs;\n        this.queries = queries;\n        this._providers = providers;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(DirectiveMetadata.prototype, \"inputs\", {\n        /**\n         * Enumerates the set of data-bound input properties for a directive\n         *\n         * Angular automatically updates input properties during change detection.\n         *\n         * The `inputs` property defines a set of `directiveProperty` to `bindingProperty`\n         * configuration:\n         *\n         * -

The goal is to allow users to avoid the\n  most obvious pitfalls and do so without compromising performance significantly.\n  For ShadowDOM styling that's not covered here, a set of best practices\n  can be provided that should allow users to accomplish more complex styling.\n\n  The following is a list of specific ShadowDOM styling features and a brief\n  discussion of the approach used to shim.\n\n  Shimmed features:\n\n  * :host, :host-context: ShadowDOM allows styling of the shadowRoot's host\n  element using the :host rule. To shim this feature, the :host styles are\n  reformatted and prefixed with a given scope name and promoted to a\n  document level stylesheet.\n  For example, given a scope name of .foo, a rule like this:\n\n    :host {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n    .foo {\n      background: red;\n    }\n\n  * encapsulation: Styles defined within ShadowDOM, apply only to\n  dom inside the ShadowDOM. Polymer uses one of two techniques to implement\n  this feature.\n\n  By default, rules are prefixed with the host element tag name\n  as a descendant selector. This ensures styling does not leak out of the 'top'\n  of the element's ShadowDOM. For example,\n\n  div {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n  x-foo div {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n\n  Alternatively, if WebComponents.ShadowCSS.strictStyling is set to true then\n  selectors are scoped by adding an attribute selector suffix to each\n  simple selector that contains the host element tag name. Each element\n  in the element's ShadowDOM template is also given the scope attribute.\n  Thus, these rules match only elements that have the scope attribute.\n  For example, given a scope name of x-foo, a rule like this:\n\n    div {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n    div[x-foo] {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  Note that elements that are dynamically added to a scope must have the scope\n  selector added to them manually.\n\n  * upper/lower bound encapsulation: Styles which are defined outside a\n  shadowRoot should not cross the ShadowDOM boundary and should not apply\n  inside a shadowRoot.\n\n  This styling behavior is not emulated. Some possible ways to do this that\n  were rejected due to complexity and/or performance concerns include: (1) reset\n  every possible property for every possible selector for a given scope name;\n  (2) re-implement css in javascript.\n\n  As an alternative, users should make sure to use selectors\n  specific to the scope in which they are working.\n\n  * ::distributed: This behavior is not emulated. It's often not necessary\n  to style the contents of a specific insertion point and instead, descendants\n  of the host element can be styled selectively. Users can also create an\n  extra node around an insertion point and style that node's contents\n  via descendent selectors. For example, with a shadowRoot like this:\n\n    <style>\n      ::content(div) {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    </style>\n    <content></content>\n\n  could become:\n\n    <style>\n      / *@polyfill .content-container div * /\n      ::content(div) {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    </style>\n    <div class=\"content-container\">\n      <content></content>\n    </div>\n\n  Note the use of @polyfill in the comment above a ShadowDOM specific style\n  declaration. This is a directive to the styling shim to use the selector\n  in comments in lieu of the next selector when running under polyfill.\n*/\nexport var ShadowCss = (function () {\n    function ShadowCss() {\n        this.strictStyling = true;\n    }\n    /*\n    * Shim some cssText with the given selector.

If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format\n *   \"[namespace]:[name]\", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"left-arrow\"></md-icon>\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"animals:cat\"></md-icon>\n *\n * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the <md-icon>\n *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at\n *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web. You can specify an\n *   alternate font by setting the fontSet input to either the CSS class to apply to use the\n *   desired font, or to an alias previously registered with MdIconRegistry.registerFontClassAlias.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon>home</md-icon>\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"myfont\">sun</md-icon>\n *\n * - Specify a font glyph to be included via CSS rules by setting the fontSet input to specify the\n *   font, and the fontIcon input to specify the icon. Typically the fontIcon will specify a\n *   CSS class which causes the glyph to be displayed via a :before selector, as in\n *   https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/\n *   Example:\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"alarm\"></md-icon>\n */\nexport var MdIcon = (function () {\n    function MdIcon(_element, _renderer, _mdIconRegistry) {\n        this._element = _element;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._mdIconRegistry = _mdIconRegistry;\n        this.hostAriaLabel = '';\n    }\n    /**\n     * Splits an svgIcon binding value into its icon set and icon name components.\n     * Returns a 2-element array of [(icon set), (icon name)].\n     * The separator for the two fields is ':'.
